# Uber-Data-Analysis-And-Visualisation
# ðŸš– Uber Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about ride demand, frequency, and behavior across different times and locations.

# ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Uber generates massive amounts of ride data every day. Analyzing this data helps understand:

Ride demand by time of day and day of the week

High and low-demand hours

Seasonal patterns

The goal is to visualize and interpret data to inform decision-making and optimize services.


# ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

Python: Programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation

NumPy: Numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn 

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis

# ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses Performed

Datetime Processing: Extracted hour, day, month, and weekday from timestamp

Time Series Analysis: Rides per hour/day/month

Heatmaps: Pickup intensity by time and location

Bar Graphs: Most common hours for rides
